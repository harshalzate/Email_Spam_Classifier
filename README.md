EMAIL SPAM DETECTION

One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata.
Developed an advanced email spam classifier leveraging machine learning algorithms, aimed at automatically discerning and filtering out spam emails from legitimate ones, thereby enhancing email security and user experience.

Utilized Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for comprehensive data preprocessing, ensuring optimal preparation of email content for subsequent analysis and feature extraction.

Successfully employed one-hot encoding to transform textual data into a numerical format conducive to model training, facilitating the creation of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. Achieved an outstanding accuracy score of 97% and a precision of 99%, showcasing proficiency in feature engineering and model development.
